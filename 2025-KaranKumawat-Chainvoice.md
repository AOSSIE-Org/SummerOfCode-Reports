## Abstract
This project presents the development and enhancement of Chainvoice, a blockchain-based invoicing platform that automates cryptocurrency payment workflows. Traditional crypto invoicing requires manual PDF sharing, error-prone address copying, and tedious payment tracking. Chainvoice eliminates these inefficiencies through automated, on-chain invoice management.

The implementation introduces privacy-enhanced invoice storage, multi-token payment support, pre-filled invoice links, batch processing, and enhanced UI/UX design. The system leverages smart contract automation and encryption technologies to create seamless payment experiences for freelancers, businesses, and Web3 organizations, transforming manual crypto invoicing into an automated, trustless system.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React.js, TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI, Material UI
- Blockchain: Foundry, Solidity
- Additional Tools: Wagmi, Viem, Rainbow Kit, React Hook Form

## Problem Statement and Motivation
Current cryptocurrency invoicing faces critical challenges:

### Manual Process Inefficiencies:
- PDF invoice sharing with wallet addresses
- Error-prone manual address copying
- Manual blockchain payment verification
- No automated invoice tracking
### Security and Privacy Concerns:
- Sensitive financial data exposed on public blockchains
- No encryption for invoice details
- Lack of access control mechanisms
### Operational Limitations:
- Limited payment token options
- No bulk processing capabilities
- Complex address sharing workflows
- Absence of professional documentation tools
